## Technologies Used

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- (Potentially) Mongoose/MongoDB for database interaction (based on `models` and `db` folders)

### Frontend
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (implied by `postcss.config.mjs` and `globals.css`)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables. A typical `.env` file might look like this:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```
    *Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB connection URI and `your_jwt_secret_key` with a strong, random string.*

4.  Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (or the PORT you specified).

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add your environment variables. A typical `.env.local` file might look like this:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    *Adjust the URL if your backend is running on a different address or port.*

4.  Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, project management, and task management. Key routes include:
- `/api/auth` (for user registration and login)
- `/api/users` (for user-related operations)
- `/api/projects` (for project-related operations)
- `/api/tasks` (for task-related operations)

Refer to the `backend/src/routes` directory for a detailed list of available endpoints and their functionalities.

## Future Enhancements & Optimizations

This section outlines potential future improvements and optimizations for the project:

### Code Quality & Development Experience
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Implement consistent linting and code formatting across both frontend and backend to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Type Checking:** Further leverage TypeScript to ensure strong typing throughout the application.

### Architectural Improvements
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Explore integrating message brokers like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication and improved scalability, especially for background tasks or inter-service communication.
- **Real-time Updates:** Implement WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time features, such as live task updates, notifications, or collaborative editing.

### Performance & Scalability
- **API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI):** Generate interactive API documentation for the backend using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to improve usability and maintainability for developers.
- **Database Optimization:** Implement advanced database indexing, query optimization, and potentially explore sharding or replication for large-scale data.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Introduce caching layers (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Load Balancing & Horizontal Scaling:** Plan for deploying the application behind a load balancer and enabling horizontal scaling for both frontend and backend services.

### Feature Enhancements
- **Task Prioritization:** Add functionality to assign and manage task priorities.
- **Bandwidth Monitoring/Graphs:** Implement monitoring and visualization for bandwidth
- **Sprint Management:** Integrate features for managing development sprints, including sprint planning, task assignment, and progress tracking.

### Deployment & Operations
- **Containerization (Docker):** Containerize both frontend and backend services using Docker for consistent development, testing, and production environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Centralized Logging & Monitoring:** Implement a robust logging and monitoring solution (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus/Grafana) for better observability and troubleshooting.
